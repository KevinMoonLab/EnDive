This is the Matlab code for the EnDive estimator. To run the estimator, only `EnDive.m` and `calculateWeightsKDE.m` are required. 

To run `Demo_EnDive.m`, you will also need to download `TruncatedGaussian.m` and `rmvnrnd.m`. 

The function `calculateWeightsKDE_cvx.m` can be used in place of `calculateWeightsKDE.m` if CVX is installed.
